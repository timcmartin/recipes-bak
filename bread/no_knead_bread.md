# No-Knead Bread

## Ingredients
* 3 cups of Flour
* 1 tsp Salt
* 1/3 tsp Active Dry Yeast
* 1 1/2 Cups + 2 Tablespoons Water

## Directions
1. Stir all dry ingredients together.
2. Add water and form a shaggy dough.
3. Cover and let sit 18 - 24 hours.
4. The dough is ready when its surface is dotted with bubbles. Flour a work surface and place dough on it; sprinkle it with a little more flour and fold it over on itself once or twice, then roughly shape into a ball. Generously coat a cotton towel (not terry cloth) with flour; put dough seam side down on towel and dust with more flour. Fold it over the bread or cover with another cotton towel and let it sit for another hour or two.
5. While the bread is resting, preheat the oven to 450°. Put a 6-8 quart heavy covered pot (cast iron, enamel, Pyrex or ceramic) in oven as it heats. When the dough is ready, carefully remove pot from oven. Slide your hand under towel and flip the dough over into the pot; it may look like a mess, but that’s OK. Cover and bake for 30 minutes, then remove the lid and bake another 10-15 minutes, until it’s nice and golden.
