This book contains my favourite recipes, collected from various sources over time.

I have tried to remember to include the source whenever possible, but when in doubt, check out [Dinner With Julie](http://www.dinnerwithjulie.com).

## Conversions

* Water boils at 212 F (sea level) 205 F (Calgary) - subtract 7 degrees from target temps.
* Hot water bath (pickle canning) no need to adjust time.

## Sourdough Notes for Noobs

Here are the instructions I follow - there are a lot of good guides around, but this seems to work alright for me.

If I am going to be baking a lot, I leave my starter on the counter and refresh it every morning.
60 grams of starter
60 grams of flour (I use 30 g of whole wheat and 30 g of all purpose, but you can play with all sorts of flours, or go all AP)
60 grams of room temp water
Mix it all up, store at room temp, discard or bake with the rest.

If I am not going to be baking, I put it in the fridge about 4 hours after feeding it.
Once a week you can take it out for an hour or two, then feed it as above, let it sit for a few more hours then put it back in the fridge.

If you want to bake with it, I take it out 2 days before and feed it in the morning and again at night to perk it up.

There are lots of recipes you can use, but this is a good place to start: https://www.theperfectloaf.com/new-baker-start-here/

There are some great tips and timings for weekday sourdough and weekend bakes.

I usually halve the recipes to make 1 loaf at a time.
