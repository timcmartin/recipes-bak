# Pickled Cauliflower

## Ingredients
* 4 500 ml (2 cup) jars
* 2 heads of cauliflower broken into florets
* 8 Thai Hot Peppers
* 1/3 cup pickling salt

### Brine
* 2 cups pickling vinegar
* 2 cups water - I missed this >:(
* 1 1/2 cups sugar
* 3 Tbs pickling spice
* 1/2 tsp turmeric

## Directions
1. Toss the cauliflower with the salt and let sit for about 3 hours.
2. Rinse and drain the cauliflower well, then dry.
3. Bring the brine ingredients to a boil and stir to dissolve the sugar.
4. Meanwhile, pack hot jars with 2 Thai peppers and as much cauliflower as they will hold.
5. Top with brine, leaving 1/2" headspace.
6. Process 20 mins (10 mins + 10 for altitude)

### Notes
* Try putting the pickling spice in the jars with the cauliflower and peppers, and dissolve the sugar and turmeric for the brine.
