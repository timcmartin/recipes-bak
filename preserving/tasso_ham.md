## Ingredients
* 5 lb Boston butt pork shoulder (preferably boneless)
* 8 oz kosher salt
* 4 oz white sugar
* 1/2 oz (15 g) LEM Backwoods Cure (pink curing salt)
* 1/4 cup white pepper
* 1/4 cup cayenne pepper
* 2 tbsp dried marjoram
* 2 tbsp ground allspice
* 2 tbsp granulated garlic
* 2 tbsp dried thyme

## Directions

1. Slice the pork butt into 1” thick steaks.
2. Combine the kosher salt, white sugar, and LEM Cure in a large flat container. Mix well. Dredge the pork steaks in the dry cure, pressing the pork into the cure to coat all surfaces. Shake excess cure off the pork and place in a clean container. Cure the pork in the refrigerator for 4 hours.
3. Rinse the cure off of the pork with cold water. Pat dry with paper towels.
4. Combine the remaining seasonings in a bowl and mix well. Season all surfaces of the pork steak with the seasoning mixture.
5. Preheat your smoker to 225ºF, set up for indirect grilling/smoking.
6. Place the pork steaks on the second shelf of the grill and smoke until the internal temperature reaches 150ºF, about 2 hours. Remove from the grill.
7. The pork can be stored in the refrigerator for up to three weeks, and in the freezer for up to three months.
