* 1/2 teaspoon pepper
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/3 cup dry white wine
* 4 Tablespoons unsalted butter
* 5 Tablespoons flour
* 1/4 cup defatted turkey drippings (optional)

### Directions
1. Bring 2 cups broth, reserved neck and giblets and trimmings to simmer in Dutch oven over high heat.  Cook, adjusting heat to maintain a simmer, stirring occasionally until all liquid evaporates and trimmings begin to sizzle (about 20 minutes).  Continue to cook for 3-4 minutes until dark fond forms on bottom of the pot.
2. Reduce heat to med-high.  Add onion, carrot, celery, parsley, thyme, garlic pepper and salt.  Cook until onion is translucent, 8-10 minutes.
3. Stir in wine and bring to simmer and scrape up fond.  Add remaining 4 cups stock and bring to simmer over high heat. Reduce heat to med-low, cover and simmer for 1 hour.  Strain through fine mesh strainer.  Can be refrigerated at this point for up to 2 days.
4. Make roux and cook, stirring constantly over med-high until deep golden brown (5-8 minutes).  Reduce heat to low and slowly whisk in strained stock.  Increase heat to med-high and bring to simmer.  Simmer until thickened (5 mins).  Add drippings if using and thin with extra stock if required.  S & P to taste.  Can be refrigerated up to 3 days or frozen for up to 2 weeks.
5. Reheat, bring to simmer over med-low heat, stirring occasionally.
