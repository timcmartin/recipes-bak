# Cream Cheese

## Ingredients

* 1 cup 35% heavy cream
* 1 cup 2% milk
* 1 1/4 cups 2% plain yogurt
* 1/2 tsp kosher salt
* 3 Tbs white vinegar

## Directions
1. In a large saucepan over medium heat, whisk together  cream,  milk,  yogurt, and  salt.   Bring to a boil, stirring constantly and making sure it doesn’t boil over, for about 2 minutes. Add  vinegar, bring to a rolling boil for 30 seconds, then lower heat to a simmer for 3 minutes more. Remove from heat and let mixture cool in the pot for an hour. The hard part is done!
2. Next, line a fine-mesh strainer with a clean cotton tea towel (or four layers of cheesecloth) and place it over a medium bowl. Pour the mixture into the lined strainer and cover with plastic wrap or a reusable silicone lid (don’t use a plate or something heavy or it will push out too much liquid). Place in the fridge to drain overnight.
3. Good morning! Discard the liquid from the bowl and spoon your gorgeous, tangy cream cheese off of the tea towel and into an airtight container, stirring until smooth. You’ll have about 1 cup, and it will keep in the fridge for up to two weeks.
