# Pizza Sauce

## Ingredients
- 3 Tbsp of olive oil
- 1 onion, finely diced
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 can of tomato paste
- 1 can of diced Italian tomatoes
- 2 Tbsp of oregano

## Directions
1. Preheat a saucepan over a medium high heat then add the olive oil and onion. Sauté until the onions soften and begin to turn golden, and then add the garlic. If you add the garlic with the onion, it will burn in the time it takes the onions to begin browning. Continue to sauté for a few more minutes, being careful not to scorch the garlic.
2. Add the tomato paste and canned tomatoes and stir well, crushing them with the back of the spoon. Add oregano, while continuing to stir then bring to a simmer. Let simmer for 30 minutes, until thickened. If you like, puree in the food processor until smooth.
