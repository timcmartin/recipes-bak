# Pesto

## Ingredients
* 3 Cups Basil, packed
* 3 Cloves of Garlic, unpeeled
* ¼ Cup plus 1½ Tablespoons Pine Nuts
* ¼ Cup plus 1-2 Tablespoons Olive Oil
* ¼ Cup plus 2 Tablespoons Parmesan cheese, grated
* Salt to taste

## Directions
1. Heat a skillet over medium heat and add the pine nuts and garlic. Toast for a few minutes or until golden brown, shaking the pan occasionally to toss the pine nuts and promote even color. Once the pine nuts are done, remove them from the pan and continue to toast the garlic. Remove it from the pan and remove the skin. Wait until both are cooled.
2. Place the basil, pine nuts, garlic, and olive oil in a blender and pulse until smooth, but still a tad grainy in texture. Place everything in a bowl and stir in the cheese. Salt to taste and store according to post directions.
