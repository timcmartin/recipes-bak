## Ingredients
* 2 cups flour
* 2/3 Tbs Salt
* 1/2 Tbs Dried Thyme
* 1/2 Tbs Dried Basil
* 1/3 Tbs Dried Oregano
* 1 Tbs Celery Salt
* 1 Tbs Black Pepper
* 1 Tbs Dried Mustard
* 4 Tbs Paprika
* 2 Tbs Garlic Salt
* 1 Tbs Ground Ginger
* 3 Tbs White Pepper
* 1 cup buttermilk
* 1 egg, beaten
* 1 chicken cut into 8 pieces

## Directions
1. Mix the flour in a bowl with all the herbs and spices; set aside.
2. Mix the buttermilk and egg together in a separate bowl until combined. Soak the chicken in the buttermilk mixture at room temperature, 20-30 minutes.
3. Remove chicken from the buttermilk, allowing excess to drip off. Dip the chicken pieces in the herb-spice-flour mixture to coat all sides, shaking off excess. Allow to sit on a rack over a baking sheet, 20 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, heat about 3 inches of the oil in a large Dutch oven (or similar heavy pot with high sides) over medium-high heat to 350 degrees. (Use a deep-frying thermometer to check the temperature.) When temperature is reached, lower the heat to medium to maintain it at 350. Fry 3 or 4 pieces at a time, being careful not to crowd the pot. Fry until medium golden brown, turning once, 15-18 minutes. Transfer chicken pieces to a baking sheet covered with paper towels. Allow the oil to return to temperature before adding more chicken. Repeat with remaining chicken.
