# Fresno Chile and Carrot Hot Sauce

## Ingredients

* 946 g water
* 34 g kosher salt
* 100 g Fresno chiles (about 6 chiles), stemmed and sliced thin
* 100 g carrots (about 2 carrots), sliced thin
* 24 g garlic cloves (about 4 cloves), sliced thin
* 45 g distilled white vinegar 
* 20 g sugar
* 13 g kosher salt 
* 2 g xanthan gum

## Directions
1. Let vegetables ferment for 5 to 7 days; check container daily, skimming residue from surface and pressing to keep vegetables submerged. After 5 days, taste vegetables daily until they have reached desired flavor. They should be sour and savory.
2.  Discard bag of brine and parchment and skim off any residue.
3. Transfer vegetables and brine to blender and process on high speed until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes.
4. Strain chile mixture through fine-mesh strainer, pressing on solids to extract as much puree as possible; reserve solids for other use.
5. Rinse out blender jar. Return chile puree to blender jar; add vinegar, sugar, and 13 grams salt and process on high speed until well combined, about 1 minute. 
6. With blender running, slowly sprinkle in xanthan gum to avoid clumping; process until mixture is slightly thickened, about 1 minute. Transfer sauce to mason jars or hot sauce bottles and refrigerate until ready to use. (Sauce can be refrigerated for up to 3 months).
