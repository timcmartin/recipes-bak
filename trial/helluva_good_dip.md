# Helluva Good Dip Clone

[Helluva Dip Clone](http://livinthecrunchylife.blogspot.com/2013/06/homemade-heavenly-good-french-onion-dip.html?m=1)
## Ingredients
* 1 1/2 cups diced Vidalia or yellow onions (about 1 large or 2 medium onions)
* 2 tbsp butter or coconut or olive oil
* pinch sea salt
* 1 clove garlic, minced (or 1/4 tsp garlic powder)
* 1 1/4 cups full-fat sour cream *see notes for dairy-free option*
* 1/4 cup mayonnaise, or more sour cream (how to make your own)
* 1/4 tsp celery salt (or 1/8 salt and 1/8 celery seed) (DIY celery salt)
* 1/8 tsp white pepper (black pepper is fine), more to taste
* 1/8 tsp cumin (optional)
* 1 1/2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
* 1/2 - 1 tsp coconut aminos (or gluten free tamari but you want want to use less salt)
* Optional 1/2 tsp unflavored gelatin plus 2 tbsp coconut milk

## Directions
1. Heat butter in a large saute pan over med heat. Add diced onions and pinch of sea salt and stir. Saute for 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally. Turn heat lower if needed to prevent onions from burning (I cook mine over low heat). Add a little water to pan if needed to prevent onions from sticking. Cook  for up to an hour if needed to caramelize. Add garlic and saute for another 5 minutes. Set aside to cool.
2. Put sour cream in food processor. Add about a tbsp of the caramelized onions and the parsley to the food processor. Process until smooth. Mix in mayo, coconut aminos, and spices, then stir in the remaining caramelized onions. (See below for adding optional gelatin.) Add additional salt and pepper to taste. Refrigerate dip for at least 6 hours or overnight for best taste (if you're in a hurry, a few hours is good enough). Makes about 1 1/2 cups.
3. Optional gelatin: This gives the dip a similar thickness to Heluva Good dip. It is not necessary for taste. Without it the dip will be thinner but still tasty. Put coconut milk or water in a small saucepan. Sprinkle 1/2 tsp gelatin over the top and mix. Put on very low heat until gelatin dissolves completely. Turn off and let sit until just cool to the touch. Add to prepared dip and mix well. Dip should thicken after several hours in the refrigerator. See my post about gelatin HERE.

## Notes:
* For dairy free: Replace sour cream with cashew sour cream. You can also replace mayo with more cashew sour cream. This wasn't my favorite version, but it did turn out well for when avoiding dairy. For cashew sour cream recipe, go HERE. I suggest using a high speed blender, like a Vitamix. Like me and don't have one of those? Use the best blender or food processor you have. Both of my are cheap so my cashew sour cream was slightly grainy. I'm not an expert on cashew creams, so check out that link.
* If you like less chunky dip, add more or all of onions to food processor. If you'd prefer not to or don't have a food processor, you don't have to process the onions. Just mix caramelized onions together with the rest of the ingredients.
* I get my coconut aminos (and other pantry items) from Vitacost. If you're a new customer, you can save $10 off your first order through my link here.
