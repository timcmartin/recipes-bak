# Bagels
(Makes a dozen)

## Ingredients
* 3 1/2 cups flour
* 2 (1/4 oz) packages active dry yeast
* 1 1/2 tsp sea salt
* 1 1/4 cups warm water
* 1/2 cup honey, divided drizzle of vegetable oil
* 1 egg yolk beaten with 1 Tbsp water, for egg wash
* 1/4 cup sesame or poppy seeds

## Directions

1. In a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the flour, yeast and salt. Slowly add the water and ¼ cup honey. Knead on a low setting for 5 minutes, until the dough comes away from the sides and a soft, smooth ball forms.
2. Lightly oil a medium bowl, and place the dough ball inside, turning it over to make sure it’s fully coated in oil. Cover with a damp tea towel and set aside in a warm place for 30 minutes.
3. Lightly flour a work surface and roll the dough into a long snake, then cut into 12 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a rope about 8 9 inches long. Pinch the ends together, then roll with the palm of your hand to seal the ends and form a bracelet— a bagel bracelet. Cover the bagels with a tea towel and let them rest on the floured surface for 15 minutes.
4. Place an oven rack on the lowest position and preheat the oven to 450°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
5. Bring a large pot of water (at least 10 cups) to a boil and add the remaining ¼ cup honey. Lower the heat to a simmer, then add four bagels at a time, simmering for two minutes, flipping each one over, and simmering for two minutes more. Remove the bagels and place on the prepared baking sheets. Repeat with two more batches of four bagels at a time.
6. Divide the bagels equally between the prepared baking sheets. Brush with egg wash and sprinkle each bagel with some sesame or poppy seeds (or place the seeds on a plate and gently press the bagels, one at a time, into the seeds).
7. Bake one sheet at a time for 18–20 minutes, or until cooked through and deeply golden brown. Let cool, then slice and schmear! They also freeze well.
