[Genius Kitchen - Hellman's Mayo Clone](http://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/hellmanns-copycat-mayonnaise-85355)

## Ingredients
- 1 egg yolk
- 2 1⁄4 teaspoons white vinegar
- 1 teaspoon water
- 1⁄4 teaspoon salt, plus
- 1⁄8 teaspoon salt
- 1⁄4 teaspoon granulated sugar, plus
- 1⁄8 teaspoon granulated sugar
- 1⁄4 teaspoon bottled lemon juice
- 1 cup soya oil (or canola oil, or walnut oil)

## Directions
1. Whisk the egg yolk by hand for 15 seconds.
2. Combine vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and lemon juice in a small bowl or glass measuring cup.
3. Stir until salt and sugar are dissolved.
4. Add half of this solution to the egg yolk and whisk for another 15 seconds.
5. Pour 1 cup of canola oil (or soybean oil) into a plastic squirt bottle.
6. This bottle will allow you to dribble the oil into the egg yolk with one hand while whisking with the other.
7. Squirt a few drops of oil into the yolk and whisk, and continue to add oil a little bit at a time while whisking non-stop.
8. When you have used about half of the oil, your mayonnaise should be very thick.
9. Add the remaining vinegar solution.
10. Whisk.
11. Now you can add the remaining oil in a steady stream while whisking until all of the oil has been added.
12. Your mayonnaise should be thick and off-white in color.
13. Put the mayonnaise into an old mayonnaise jar and seal it with a lid.
14. Leave this out on your kitchen counter for 8 to 10 hours so that the vinegar and lemon juice can kill any potential bacteria in the egg yolk.
15. Keep up to 2 weeks in your refrigerator.
