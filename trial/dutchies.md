## Intredients

* 1 cup sultana raisins
* 1 cup 2% milk
* 8-g pkg quick-rise instant yeast
* 1/4 cup granulated sugar
* 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
* 1 egg
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* canola oil, for frying

### GLAZE
* 2 cups icing sugar
* 1/4 cup water

## Directions
1. SOAK raisins with 1 cup boiling water from the kettle in a small bowl until plump, 10 min. Drain well.
2. MICROWAVE milk until warm, 45 sec. Pour into bowl of a stand mixer fitted with dough hook. Add yeast and stir. Let stand for 10 min.
3. BEAT in raisins, granulated sugar, butter, egg and salt. Add flour. Beat on medium-high until dough forms a ball and pulls away cleanly from the sides and bottom of the bowl, about 5 min. (Mixer may move around the counter during beating process.)
4. SPRAY a medium bowl with oil. Turn dough out of mixer bowl into oiled bowl. Lightly oil top of dough and cover with a damp tea towel (not terry cloth). Let stand in a warm place until dough doubles in size, about 1 hour.
5. LINE a large baking sheet with parchment. Lightly spray with oil. Roll out dough on a floured surface to a 1/2-in. thick square. Cut into 12 squares. Transfer to prepared sheet. Cover with same damp tea towel and let stand until doughnuts double in size, about 45 min.
6. POUR oil into a large pot until it reaches 1-in. up the sides. Clip a deep-fry thermometer to the side. Heat over medium until temperature reaches 350F. Adjust heat as necessary to keep temperature at 350F during cooking. Fry doughnuts, 4 at a time, flipping halfway through, until golden, 3 to 4 min. Drain on paper towels.
7. SET a wire rack over a piece of parchment.  Whisk icing sugar with water in a medium bowl until smooth. Dip each doughnut into icing mixture, turning with two forks to cover completely. Carefully transfer to rack and let stand until glaze is firm.
