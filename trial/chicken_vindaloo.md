# Chicken Vindaloo

## Ingredients

* 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons white vinegar, divided
* 12 medium garlic cloves, smashed and peeled
* 1 inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped
* 2 tablespoons sweet paprika
* 2 tablespoons packed brown sugar
* 4 whole cloves or 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
* 2 1/2 teaspoons ground turmeric
* 2 teaspoons cumin seeds
* 1/2 - 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* Kosher salt and ground black pepper
* 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed and halved
* 2 tablespoons neutral oil
* Fresno or jalape√±o chilies, stemmed and sliced into thin rings, to serve
* Fresh cilantro leaves, to serve

## Directions

1. In a blender, combine 1/4 cup vinegar, garlic, ginger, paprika, sugar, cloves, turmeric, cumin, cayenne, cinnamon, 1 1/4 teaspoons each salt and pepper, and 3 tablespoons water. Puree until smooth, scraping the blender as needed. Pour into a medium bowl, add the chicken and toss to coat. Let stand at room temperature for 15 minutes.
2. In a large Dutch oven over medium, heat the oil until shimmering. Add the chicken and marinade, distributing in an even layer, then cook without stirring until the marinade has browned and the chicken releases easily from the pot, 5 to 9 minutes. Stir, then add 1/3 cup water and bring to a simmer. Cover, reduce to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until a skewer inserted into the chicken meets no resistance, 35 to 45 minutes.
3. Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons vinegar, increase to medium and cook, stirring often, until the sauce is thick enough that a spoon drawn through leaves a trail, about 8 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a serving dish and sprinkle with sliced chilies and cilantro.
