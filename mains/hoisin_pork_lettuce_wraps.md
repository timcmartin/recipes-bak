## Ingredients
- canola or vegetable oil, for cooking

1. Set a large skillet over medium-high heat.
2. Add a drizzle of canola and sesame oil and sauté the pepper for a few minutes, until starting to soften.
3. Add the pork and cook, breaking up the meat with a spoon until it’s no longer pink.
4. Add the soy sauce, cilantro and onions to the pan and cook, breaking everything up and stirring to combine until everything is cooked and any excess moisture has cooked off.
5. Add the hoisin sauce and stir to heat through.
