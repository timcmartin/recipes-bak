# Detroit Pizza

## Dough

### Ingredients
* 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
* 2 1/4 cups (11 1/4 ounces) all-purpose flour
* 1 1/2 teaspoons instant or rapid-rise yeast
* 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar
* 1 cup water, room temperature
* 3/4 teaspoon salt
* 10 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, shredded (2 1/2 cups)

## Sauce

### Ingredients
* 1 cup canned crushed tomatoes
* 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
* 1 garlic clove, minced
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1 teaspoon dried basil
* 1/2 teaspoon sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon pepper
* 1/4 teaspoon salt

* Combine all ingredients in bowl - can be refrigerated for 24 hours ahead

### Directions
1. Spray 13 by 9-inch nonstick baking pan with vegetable oil spray, then brush bottom and sides of pan with oil. Using stand mixer fitted with dough hook, mix flour, yeast, and sugar on low speed until combined, about 10 seconds. With mixer running, slowly add room-temperature water and mix until dough forms and no dry flour remains, about 2 minutes, scraping down bowl as needed. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand for 10 minutes.
2.  Add salt to bowl and knead on medium speed until dough forms satiny, sticky ball that clears sides of bowl, 6 to 8 minutes. Turn dough onto lightly floured counter and knead until smooth, about 1 minute.
3.  Transfer dough to prepared pan, cover with plastic, and let rest for 15 minutes. Using your well-oiled hands, press dough into corners of pan. (If dough resists stretching, let it rest for another 10 minutes before trying again to stretch.) Cover with plastic and let dough rise at room temperature until nearly tripled in volume and large bubbles form, 2 to 3 hours. Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 500 degrees.
4. Sprinkle Monterey Jack evenly over dough to edges of pan. Spoon three 1-inch-wide strips of sauce, using 1/3 cup sauce for each, over cheese evenly down length of pan.
5.  Bake until cheese is bubbly and browned, about 15 minutes. Let pizza cool in pan on wire rack for 5 minutes. Run knife around edge of pan to loosen pizza. Using spatula, slide pizza onto cutting board. Cut into 8 pieces and serve.
