# Perfect Ramen

[Dinner With Julie - Chef Roy Choi's Perfect Ramen](http://www.dinnerwithjulie.com/2015/02/08/ramen-egg-cheese/)

## Ingredients
* 1 pkg. instant ramen noodles
* 1 egg
* 1 tsp. butter
* grated carrot, fresh spinach, or leftover veggies (totally optional)
* 2 processed cheese slices
* toasted sesame seeds
* chopped green onion
* Sriracha

## Directions
1. Cook the noodles like you normally would - according to the package directions - when the noodles are about halfway cooked, crack in the egg and poach it in the broth over low heat, basting with broth or covering with a lid briefly to help it cook through.
2. Carefully pour the lot into a bowl, add the butter and any veggies you like, and immediately top with the cheese slices. Sprinkle with sesame seeds, green onion and Sriracha to taste and serve immediately.
