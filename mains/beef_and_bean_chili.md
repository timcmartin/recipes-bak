## Directions

### Pressure Cooker
1. Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in slow cooker on sear function. Season the beef with salt and pepper. Add half the beef to the pot in a single layer and cook, turning, until browned, about 4 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Add 1 more tablespoon vegetable oil to the pot and brown the remaining beef; remove to the bowl.
2. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons vegetable oil. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and browned, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and chipotle and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 2 minutes.
3. Add the chili powder, cumin, 1/2 teaspoon salt and the tomato paste; cook, stirring, until deep red, about 2 minutes.
4. Add the beef and any juices from the bowl, the tomatoes, beef broth and 2 cups water. Pressure cook on high pressure for 30 minutes.
5. Move everything to dutch oven, add the beans with their liquid and simmer until the chili is thickened, 20 to 30 minutes. Season with salt, pepper and more chili powder. Top as desired.

### Stove Top
1. Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over high heat. Season the beef with salt and pepper. Add half the beef to the pot in a single layer and cook, turning, until browned, about 4 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Add 1 more tablespoon vegetable oil to the pot and brown the remaining beef; remove to the bowl.
2. Reduce the heat to medium and add the remaining 2 tablespoons vegetable oil. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and browned, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and chipotle and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 2 minutes.
3. Add the chili powder, cumin, 1/2 teaspoon salt and the tomato paste; cook, stirring, until deep red, about 2 minutes.
4. Add the beef and any juices from the bowl, the tomatoes, beef broth and 2 cups water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat so the liquid simmers. Cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot occasionally, until the meat is fork-tender, about 1 1/2 hours.
5. Add the beans with their liquid and simmer until the chili is thickened, 20 to 30 minutes. Season with salt, pepper and more chili powder. Top as desired.
