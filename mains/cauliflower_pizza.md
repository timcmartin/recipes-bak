## Cauliflower Pizza Crust

## Ingredients
* 1 head cauliflower, stalk removed
* 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella
* 1/4 cup grated Parmesan
* 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
* 2 eggs, lightly beaten

## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Break the cauliflower into florets and pulse in a food processor until fine. Steam in a steamer basket and drain well. (I like to put it on a towel to get all the moisture out.) Let cool.
3. In a bowl, combine the cauliflower with the mozzarella, Parmesan, oregano, salt, garlic powder and eggs. Transfer to the center of the baking sheet and spread into a circle, resembling a pizza crust. Bake for 20 minutes.
4. Add desired toppings and bake an additional 10 minutes.
