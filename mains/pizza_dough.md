# Pizza Dough

## Ingredients
* 1 pkg. (2 tsp.) active dry yeast
* pinch sugar
* 2 1/2 – 3 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 Tbsp. (or a good glug) olive oil
* 1 tsp. salt

## Directions
1. Put 1 cup warm water into a large bowl, add the sugar and sprinkle the yeast overtop; let stand for 5 minutes, until it gets foamy.
2. Add 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour, the olive oil and salt and stir until you have a shaggy dough.
3. Let rest for 20 minutes, then knead until smooth and elastic, adding more flour if you need it – the dough should be tacky, but not too sticky.
4. If you like, place the dough in an oiled bowl and turn to coat all over.
5. Cover with a tea towel and set aside in a warm place – if you’re in a hurry, it only needs to wait for about an hour, until it’s doubled in bulk. If you have time, leave it. When it gets too big, punch it down.
6. If you’re going out or to bed, cover it and put it in the fridge, which will slow the rise.
7. Or freeze it. Take it out to thaw or warm up before you use it
8. Cook oven at 450
