# Top 9 tips to make perfect barbecue brisket in your own backyard

## By Steven Raichlen - The New York Times

Never in the annals of American barbecue has brisket — great brisket — been so widely available.

Once the province of Texas and Kansas City, Missouri, world-class brisket now turns up at Hometown Bar-B-Que in Brooklyn, New York; at Lewis Barbecue in Charleston, South Carolina; and at Smoque BBQ and Green Street Smoked Meats in Chicago. Once deemed a low-value cut (Tootsie Tomanetz, the 84-year-old pitmaster at Snow’s BBQ in Lexington, Texas, remembers grinding it to make hamburgers), brisket now commands top dollar at meat markets and barbecue restaurants.

And, once sold only as USDA Choice or Select, it now comes in premium categories like Prime and Wagyu. Its status was affirmed in 2015, when Aaron Franklin, of Franklin Barbecue in Austin, Texas, won a James Beard award for best chef in the Southwest.

Yet brisket remains oddly off-limits for one large segment of the population: home cooks.

The cut intimidates the uninitiated for many reasons. First, its sheer size: A whole packer brisket (so called because that’s how it’s shipped from the packing house) weighs 12-18 pounds, making it the largest cut of meat most people will ever attempt to cook at home.

Then there is brisket’s singular anatomy: two different muscles, one stacked atop the other, slightly askew and connected by a seam of fat. One muscle is fatty (the pectoralis superficialis, better known as the point), the other lean (the pectoralis profundus, a.k.a. the flat). Both are loaded with tough, collagen-rich connective tissue that gives the meat its structure, but requires low-temperature cooking for most of a day to achieve the proper tenderness.

There’s also the matter of gear. Brisket pros like Franklin and John Lewis of Lewis Barbecue cook in enormous pits fashioned from 1,000-gallon propane tanks that they designed and welded themselves. The cooking times are equally imposing, requiring a commitment of 8-12 hours or even longer.

Well, take comfort, because barbecuing a brisket in your backyard is less daunting than you think. It requires only four ingredients: beef, salt, pepper and wood smoke. There’s no need for a competition-grade smoker; you can make excellent brisket in a common kettle grill or Weber Smokey Mountain, or a ceramic cooker like a Big Green Egg.

True, it takes time and practice, and you may find yourself tending the fire when you’d rather be sleeping. But the results — crisp, salty, peppery bark (the crust) encasing moist, smoky, luscious, tender meat — make the effort worthwhile.

I’ve been researching brisket and cooking a lot of it at home for my new book, “The Brisket Chronicles” (Workman Publishing). With input from some of the nation’s top brisket masters, I’ve distilled the process to nine simple steps.

1. The Meat

Choose a full packer brisket if you’re feeling ambitious. Special-order it from your butcher, and plan to spend a full day preparing it. For a more manageable cut, buy a 4- to 5-pound brisket flat, available at most supermarkets; you can smoke it in six to eight hours. (Sometimes you’ll find portions of packer briskets containing both point and flat; they cook in eight to 10 hours.)

Prime brisket, favoured by the professionals, is more generously marbled than Choice, but Choice delivers ample flavour, too. For the ultimate brisket experience, order a Wagyu brisket online. Trim off the excess fat, but leave at least a quarter-inch layer to keep the meat moist during cooking.

2. The Seasoning

Most brisket pros use a simple seasoning of salt and pepper (often referred to as a Dalmatian rub, on account of its speckled appearance). Billy Durney of Brooklyn’s Hometown Bar-B-Que favours a 4-to-1 mixture of 16-mesh (coarsely ground) black pepper and kosher salt, which he applies a few hours ahead to give them time to penetrate the meat. Lewis slathers his meat with a mixture of mustard and pickle juice before applying the seasonings, to help them adhere to the meat and add an extra layer of flavour. My preference is equal parts coarse salt and cracked black peppercorns, with a spoonful of red-pepper flakes for heat.

3. The Cooker

Durney cooked his first brisket on a Weber Smokey Mountain. Burt Bakman of Slab in Los Angeles started on a Big Green Egg. Franklin cooked his first brisket in an inexpensive New Braunfels, while Lewis began his career with a smoker he rigged from a trash can. This is to say that you can make great brisket in a common backyard charcoal burner.

Other popular options these days are a pellet grill or an electric smoker, both of which do a fine job of maintaining a steady stream of smoke and consistent temperature, but sometimes deliver a tad less flavour than a charcoal burner. I’ve never had much luck barbecuing a brisket on a gas grill. (It’s hard to run one at 250 degrees F — 121 Celsius — and it’s even harder to generate enough wood smoke.) If you do use a gas grill, Lewis suggests placing a metal pan with lit charcoal and wood chunks on the grate next to the meat.

4. The Smoke

Cooking a brisket is a two-phase process. In the first, you set the bark and flavour the meat with wood smoke. This produces the smoke ring, a much-admired reddish band just below the surface — the result of a chemical reaction between the nitrogen dioxide in the smoke and the myoglobin in the meat. The second phase of cooking finishes rendering the fat and converting the tough collagen into tender gelatin.

Wood smoke is the soul of barbecued brisket. Pitmasters speak reverentially of “blue smoke,” a thin, wispy smoke filled with flavour-rich phenols. When using a kettle grill, water smoker or kamado-style cooker, fuel it with natural lump charcoal, adding hardwood chunks or chips to generate wood smoke. Texans favour oak (and sometimes mesquite), while Kansas Citians like to burn apple or hickory. Any seasoned hardwood will do. Buy it in chunks or chips; if using chips, soak them in water for 30 minutes, then drain, to slow combustion. Add the wood gradually, a couple of chunks or handfuls of chips every hour: You want to kiss the meat with smoke, not smother it.

5. The Temperature

The pros use complicated formulas for heat management. Lewis starts cooking his brisket at 125 degrees F (51 C), gradually increasing the heat to finish at 325 F (162 C); Franklin runs his pits at temperatures ranging from 255 to over 300 F (124 to 128 C). I recommend staying around 250 degrees F (121 C). Maintain this temperature by adjusting the vents on your smoker (start with the bottom or intake vent). More airflow gives you a hotter fire; less air reduces the heat.

A digital temperature-control system (sometimes called an airflow controller) lets you dial in a precise cooking temperature and hold it there for the duration. (A thermostatically controlled electric fan regulates the air intake.) While you’re at it, pick up an instant-read meat thermometer, preferably wireless.

While smoking the meat, you may experience the dreaded “stall,” in which the internal meat temperature plateaus around 150 to 160 degrees F (66 to 71 C), or even drops, as liquid evaporates from the surface of the brisket. Be patient: Eventually the temperature will rise again.

6. The Wrap

The second phase of cooking begins when the brisket reaches an internal temperature of 165-170 F (74 to 77 C). This is the point at which most brisket masters wrap the meat in butcher paper or aluminum foil. Franklin and Lewis wrap in “pink” or “peach” paper, unlined butcher paper that seals in the meat juices while allowing the excess steam to escape. Other pitmasters, like Tomanetz, wrap in aluminum foil, a process known as the Texas Crutch. This guarantees a tender brisket, but sometimes results in a steamed texture reminiscent of pot roast.

Home cooks can order unlined butcher paper online, or use parchment paper; just don’t use plastic-lined butcher paper.

7. The Test

When it comes to determining whether a brisket is done, the pros wax rhapsodic, even mystical. Durney uses the jiggle test: Grab the meat by one end and shake it. A properly cooked brisket will quiver like bovine Jell-O. Or use the bend test: Wearing insulated food gloves, grab the brisket at both ends and lift. It should bend or sag easily in the middle.

Bakman monitors the internal temperature with a thermometer, but also uses an old-fashioned digital test: “When you can push your finger into the side of the flat, the brisket is ready.” Franklin judges chiefly by feeling “the floppiness and softness.” Thermometers “are great to give you a rough idea,” he said, “but feel and intuition have the final say.”

I use an instant-read meat thermometer, with a target temperature of 200-205 F (93 to 96 C).

8. The Rest

After an hour spent trimming and seasoning the brisket and building the fire, and the better part of a day spent cooking, you’ll probably want to eat your brisket right away. But resting it in an insulated cooler for an hour or two improves its texture and tenderness immeasurably. Franklin keeps it wrapped in the butcher paper. Durney recommends swaddling the whole shebang, meat and paper, in a beach towel before resting it in the cooler until the internal temperature falls to about 142 degrees F (61 C).

Resting relaxes the meat, allowing the juices to redistribute, and allow you to control when you serve the brisket, which is useful given the broad range of cooking times.

9. The Carve

Carving a brisket flat is easy: Simply slice it across the grain to the thickness of a No. 2 pencil. Carving a packer brisket is more challenging because the meat fibres of the point run almost perpendicular to those of the flat. Franklin takes a divide-and-conquer approach: He cuts the packer brisket roughly in half across its width, slicing the flat across the grain on the diagonal from one corner to the other, and slicing the point section from the front edge to the back. Before you start, trim off and discard any large visible pockets of fat.

Yes, restaurant-quality brisket can be made at home, with surprisingly few ingredients and not that much prep time. But it still requires considerable attention and supervision.

“There are no shortcuts,” Franklin said. “People know what you had to go through to get it right.”

## Cooking Notes

### Canada Day Weekend, 2019

> Canada Day weekend, 2019 I rubbed my brisket with salt, pepper and red pepper flakes.
Started smoking it around noon, at 270.  Wrapped at 165 in foil, done after 9 hours.
Pulled off, and let cool in foil.  After 3 hours, sealed it in vacuum bag and put in the fridge.
The next day, pulled it out about an hour before heating.  Put it in a cooler with boiling water,
and let set for about 3 hours, but was good after 2.  Deeeeeeelicious.

### July 20, 2020

> July 20, 2020 just for fun.  12 pounds, dalmation rub, WSM.  Went to start smoker and wind and rain kicked up - decided to wait.
Got up around 3, and started smoker - 1/2 chimney (a little too much) and filled bottom ring with more charcoal and oak and cherry chunks.
Trimmed and rubbed brisket - charcoal wouldn't start.  Restarted - too hot so took out some coals which worked.
Brisket on at 4, BBQ Guru set to 260.  Stayed pretty true, up to 300 at one point, but seemed to be just a flare up.
Wrapped at 150, got up to 203 - 9 hours.  Pulled off to rest in cooler.  Bark was a little light, but smoke ring was off the hook.
Very juicy, perfectly cooked.
