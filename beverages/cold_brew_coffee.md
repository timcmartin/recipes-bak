# Cold Brewed Coffee in French Press
[Source](http://www.thecoffeecompass.com/how-to-make-cold-brew-coffee-with-a-french-press/)

## Directions
* Most cold brew coffee recipes use a 7:1 water to coffee ratio. In other words, for every liter of water youâ€™re going to use about 140 grams of coffee.
* Really coarse grind, add water and stir.
* With this corse of a grind, the coffee should be allowed to steep for 12 hours at room temperature. If you want to slow down the process, (i.e. not wake up at 4 am to decant cold brew) you can steep it in the refrigerator to add a few hours.  Put the lid back on the French press, but be careful not to plunge it.
* Decant into mason jar.
* Pour through a rinsed filter before serving.
