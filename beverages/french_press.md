## Ratios
* 1 : 12 (coffee : water)
* 30 g of beans : 354 g of water (tried - pretty good, made one red mug)
* 42 g of beans : 504 g of water
* Cabin has a 4 cup press

## Directions
* Bring water to a boil and let sit two minutes.
* Measure coffee by weight into French Press.
* Tare the scale and measure amount of water.
* Stir, and place lid on beaker to keep things warm.  Let steep for 3:30.
* For a full bodied final result use the spoon to gently break up the crust and briefly stir it. This will cause most of the coffee to fall to the bottom of the beaker.
* For a light bodied final result use the spoon to scoop the crust off and discard it. Keep scooping until you have removed all the floating coffee grounds
* Plunge.
