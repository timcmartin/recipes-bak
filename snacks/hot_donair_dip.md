# Hot Donair Dip
>> From Allison Seto, Getty Dip Off

## Ingredients

* 1 lb lean ground beef
* 1 tsp dried oregano
* 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
* 2 tsp paprika
* 2 tsp garlic powder
* 1 tsp onion powder
* 1/2 tsp each salt and black pepper
* 1 8oz container regular cream cheese
* 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella
* 1 cup donair sauce
* 1 tomato, seeded and diced

## Directions

1. In a bowl, mix together the ground beef and spices and blend well. Really, really, really knead it together well.
2. Fry up the meat mixture, breaking it apart with a wooden spoon as it cooks (you don’t want any chunks of meat too big - it has to remain scoopable)
3. While the meat is browning, make your donair sauce (see below) and then in your cooking dish (a 9ʺ glass pie plate or small casserole dish) mix together the cream cheese, donair sauce and shredded mozzarella.
4. Once the meat is cooked and well-browned, use a slotted spoon to transfer the meat (but not the grease) to the cooking dish and fold it in to the cream cheese mixture. If you won’t be eating it until later, you can cover and put in the fridge at this point.
5. When it’s go-time, just pop the dip into a preheated 350 degree oven and cook it for 20 minutes. Sprinkle the diced tomatoes (and some minced onions if you like) over the top of the hot dip and serve.
