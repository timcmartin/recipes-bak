# Peanut Butter Energy Bites

## Ingredients
* 1 cup (~220 g) dates, pitted (if dry, soak in warm water for 10 minutes, then drain well)
* 3 Tbsp all natural salted peanut or almond butter
* 1/4 cup dairy free dark chocolate, roughly chopped
* 1 Tbsp chia seeds (or sub flax or hemp seeds)
* 2/3 cup gluten free rolled oats

## Instructions
1. Pulse dates in a food processor or blender until theyâ€™re in small pieces or it forms a ball (see photo).
2. Add oats, chocolate, chia seeds and peanut butter and pulse or mix until combined. You want there to be consistently small pieces but not overly processed.
3. Carefully roll into 1-inch balls (29-30 grams per ball), using the warmth of your hands to mold them together. Should yield 14-15 balls.
4. To set, pop in fridge or freezer for 15 minutes. Otherwise, eat as is! Will keep fresh in an air-tight bag or container for up to a week. Freeze for longer term storage.
