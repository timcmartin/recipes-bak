## Ingredients
* 3 tablespoons peanut oil
* 3 ounces popcorn kernels
* 1/2 teaspoon popcorn salt

2. Place the bowl over medium heat and shake constantly using tongs to hold the bowl. Continue shaking until the popcorn finishes popping, about 3 minutes.
3. Remove the bowl from the heat and carefully remove the foil. Stir in any salt that is on the side of the bowl.
4. Melt the butter in a microwave oven. Slowly drizzle it over the popcorn while spinning the bowl. Serve immediately.
