# [Jalapeno Cheddar Cornbread](#jalapeno_cheddar_cornbread)

[Basics With Babish](https://basicswithbabish.co/basicsepisodes/cornbread)

## Ingredients
* 5 oz of finely ground cornmeal
* 5 oz of all-purpose flour
* 1/2 tsp of baking powder
* 1/2 tsp of baking soda
* 1 tsp of kosher salt
* 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper
* 4 oz of grated cheddar cheese
* 1/2 cup of fresh corn kernels
* 1 1/2 cups of buttermilk
* 2 tbsp of honey or sweetener of choice
* 2 Jalapeño peppers
* 2 large eggs
* 1 stick of melted butter
* Honey
* Flakey salt

## Directions
1. In a mixing bowl, combine 5 ounces of finely ground cornmeal and 5 ounces of all-purpose flour. Add ½ a teaspoon of baking powder, ½ a teaspoon of baking soda, 1 teaspoon of kosher salt, and ½ a teaspoon of cayenne pepper. Whisk together accordingly. Next, add 4 ounces of grated cheddar cheese and toss to coat with the dry ingredients so that nothing sticks together.
2. Use a food processor to pulse together ½ a cup of fresh corn kernels, 1 ½ cups of buttermilk, and 2 tablespoons of honey or sweetener of choice. Then, add 1 jalapeño pepper that is cored and quartered. Give it 6 to 8 pulses until the jalapeño is nicely chopped.
3. Next, add 2 large eggs as well as 1 stick of melted butter that is completely cooled off to prevent the eggs from scrambling. Pulse 4 to 5 times to combine.
4. Take your mixing bowl of dry ingredients and dig a well in the center. Pour in your wet mixture from the food processor and gently mix together with a paddle. If the batter is over mixed, it can become tough.
5. Coat a cast iron skillet with butter and carefully add your cornbread batter. Smooth out the top of the batter and garnish with a few slices of jalapeño pepper. Place the skillet into a 425 degree-Fahrenheit oven for 20 to 25 minutes.
6. Ensure that the cornbread is cooked by using a toothpick and making sure that there are only a few moist crumbs remaining on the toothpick. After allowing the cornbread to cool in the skillet for about 5 to 10 minutes, give it a drizzle of honey and brush it on for even coverage to create a shiny and sticky glaze. Then, give it a sprinkling of flaky sea salt.
7. Carefully remove the cornbread from the skillet and allow it to cool on a wire rack for about 10 to 15 minutes before slicing and serving while it is still warm.
