# Corn Bread

## Ingredients
* 1 cup (120g) cornmeal
* 1 cup (125g) all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/8 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled
* 1/3 cup (67g) packed light brown sugar
* 2 Tablespoons (30ml) honey
* 1 large egg, at room temperature
* 1 cup (240ml) buttermilk, at room temperature
* Parmesan Cheese - whack

## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 400째F (204째C).
2. Grease and lightly flour an 8 or 9-inch square baking pan. Set aside.
3. Whisk together the cornmeal, flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Set aside.
4. In a medium bowl, whisk the cooled melted butter, brown sugar, and honey together until completely smooth and thick. There should be no brown sugar lumps. Then, whisk in the egg until combined. Finally, whisk in the buttermilk.
5. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk until combined. Avoid overmixing.
6. Pour batter into prepared baking pan. Bake for 20 minutes or until golden brown on top and the center is cooked through. Use a toothpick to test. Edges should be crispy at this point! Allow to slightly cool before slicing and serving. Serve cornbread with butter, honey, jam, whatever you like. Wrap leftovers up tightly and store at room temperature for up to 1 week.
7. Make ahead tip: For longer storage, freeze baked cornbread for up to 3 months. Allow to thaw overnight in the refrigerator and heat up in the microwave or bake in a 300째F (149째C) oven for 10 minutes.
