# Jason's Grandma's 2 Hour Buns

[Dinner With Julie - 2 Hour Buns](http://www.dinnerwithjulie.com/2017/11/01/jasons-grandmas-hour-buns/)

## Ingredients
* 3 1/2-4 cups all-purpose flour
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 1 Tbsp instant dry yeast
* 1 1/2 cups warm water
* 1/4 cup vegetable oil
* 1 egg
* 1 tsp salt

## Directions
1. In a large bowl, combine 2 cups of the flour, the sugar and yeast. In another bowl, whisk together the water, oil and egg. Add to the flour mixture and stir until well blended. Add the remaining flour and salt, stirring until the dough comes together.
2. Knead for 5-7 minutes, scattering some extra flour on your countertop if it needs it, until the dough is smooth and elastic.
3. Let sit and rise for 15 minutes, then punch the dough down and let it rise for another 15 minutes.
4. Punch the dough down again and shape it into 18 buns.
5. Place them close together in a buttered or parchment-lined 9-x13-inch baking dish, cover with a tea towel and let them rise for about 1 hour, or until doubled in bulk.
6. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350F. Bake the buns for 15-18 minutes, or until deep golden. Makes about 1 1/2 dozen buns.
