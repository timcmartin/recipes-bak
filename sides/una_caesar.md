## Kale Salad

### Ingredients
- 2 tbsp Olive Oil, plus more, if needed
- 4 thin slices Prosciutto, julienned
- 1/2 cup Panko Bread Crumbs
- Sea Salt & Black Pepper
- 2 bunches Kale, leaves only, julienned
- 1 cup Pecorino Romano, grated
- 2 soft boiled Eggs, peeled & halved

### Directions
1. Line a plate with paper towels. Heat olive oil in a medium frying pan over medium-high heat. Add strips of prosciutto and pan-fry until crispy, about 5 minutes. Transfer to towel-lined plate and set aside.
2. Reduce heat to low. Add panko crumbs to pan, adding a little more oil if required, and toast, stirring frequently, until golden, about 2 minutes. Scrape the panko into a small bowl, season with salt and pepper, and set aside.
3. Place kale in a large bowl, pour in the dressing and toss to coat. Season with salt and pepper. At this point, either transfer the kale to smaller serving bowls, or if you would rather serve from a big bowl, leave it in there. Top kale with pecorino romano, toasted panko, and crispy prosciutto. Serve with the boiled eggs.
