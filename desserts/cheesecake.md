[Dinner With Julie - Cheesecake in a Jar](http://www.dinnerwithjulie.com/2016/06/13/braised-cherry-cheesecake-in-a-jar/)

## Crust
* 3 graham crackers or Digestive biscuits, bashed up

## Cheesecake Filling
* 1 8 oz (250 g) pkg. cream cheese, at room temperature
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 1/2 cup heavy (whipping) cream
* 1/4 tsp. vanilla

## Topping
* 2 cups fresh or frozen cherries, pitted (or chopped peaches or rhubarb, strawberries, raspberries…)
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 1/4 cup water
* 1 tsp. cornstarch

## Directions
1. Bash the cookies in a ziplock bag and divide the coarse crumbs between the bottoms of 6 small (125 mL) ring-top jars.
2. In a medium bowl, beat the cream cheese, sugar, cream and vanilla until smooth. Divide between the jars, spooning it over the crumbs.
3. To make the topping, bring your cherries, sugar and water to a simmer in a medium saucepan. Cook for 10-15 minutes, until the cherries are soft, squishing some of them against the side of the pan with your spoon. Stir the cornstarch into 1 tsp. cold water and add it to the cherries; simmer for a minute or two. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool, then refrigerate until chilled.
4. Spoon the cherries over the cheesecakes. Screw on the lids and refrigerate until you’re ready to serve them. Makes 6 cheesecake jars.
