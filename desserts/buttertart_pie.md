[Butter Tart Pie - Dinner With Julie](http://www.dinnerwithjulie.com/2020/03/10/butter-tart-pie/)

>Note: Glass pie plate took 40 minutes, enamel plate took around 30 miinutes

## Ingredients

* [Pastry for a single crust pie](pie_dough.md)
* 3/4 cup packed brown sugar
* 3/4 cup Roger’s Golden, maple or corn syrup
* 2 large eggs
* 1/4-1/3 cup soft, grated or melted butter
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 1/4 tsp salt
* a handful of currants, raisins or chopped pecans (optional)

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 425F.
2. On a lightly floured surface, roll the pastry out slightly larger than your pie plate, and loosely fit it into the pan. Trim and crimp the edge however you like.
3. In a medium bowl (or the same one you used to make pastry), stir together the brown sugar, syrup, eggs, butter, vanilla and salt. Scatter a handful of currants, raisins and/or pecans over the bottom of the pie and pour the filling overtop.
4. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to 350F and bake for another 40-45 minutes, until the pastry is deep golden and the filling wobbles evenly, and doesn’t look runny in the middle. Let cool completely (or almost) before slicing. Serves 8.
