# Banana Bread

## Ingredients
* 3 very ripe bananas
* 1/2-3/4 cup sugar
* 2-4 Tbsp. canola, olive or flax oil
* 2 large eggs
* a big splash of vanilla
* 1 1/2 cups flour (I usually use half all-purpose, half whole wheat, oat or quinoa flour)
* 1 tsp. baking soda
* 1/4 tsp. salt
* a handful of chopped walnuts, chocolate chips, raisins, coconut, fresh or frozen blueberries (optional)

## Directions
* Preheat the oven to 350°F.
* In a large bowl, mash the bananas, sugar, oil, eggs and vanilla with a potato masher - don't worry about getting all the lumps out. It will look sort of cottage-cheesy.
* Add the flour, baking soda and salt and stir until almost combined; add any additions and stir just until blended.
* Spread into a buttered 8”x4” loaf pan and bake for 50 minutes, until golden and cracked on top and springy to the touch.
