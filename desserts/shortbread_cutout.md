## Ingredients
- 1 cup (250 mL) unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 1/2 cup (125 mL) packed brown sugar
- 1/2 tsp (2 mL) vanilla extract
- 2 1/2 cups (625 mL) all-purpose flour
- 1/4 tsp salt

## Directions
1. Heat oven to 325°F (160°C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. Using electric mixer, cream together butter, sugar and vanilla until light and fluffy. Stir in flour and salt, 1/2 cup (125 mL) at a time; mix until all flour is incorporated and dough forms ball. Cover and refrigerate for 10 minutes.
3. Working on lightly floured surface, roll dough out until approximately 1/2 inch (1 cm) thick; cut into 24 rectangles. Using a spatula, transfer cookies to prepared baking sheets, placing 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart.
4. Bake, in batches, for 12 to 15 minutes or just until cookies begin to brown. Cool completely on baking sheets before transferring to storage containers.
