# Squirrel Repellant

If you are trying to keep squirrels away from bird feeders or flower beds, try this dry repellent. From your spice rack, gather paprika, cayenne pepper, and crushed red pepper flakes. Sprinkle a mixture of these spices where you don’t want squirrels to dig or tread. You can even mix them in with your wild birdseed to keep the squirrels from eating it.

Don’t worry, about the spicy infusion irritating birds that use the feeder. They lack the same taste buds to actually transmit signals of heat, so for them it’s actually a treat that just makes the seed taste even better.
