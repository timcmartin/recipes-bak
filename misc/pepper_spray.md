# Pepper Spray - Squirrel Repellant

Fill a pot with 1 1/2 quarts of water, and bring it to a boil over the stove before adding 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, two chopped onions, and a single chopped jalape√±o. Allow this mixture to boil for about 30 minutes, and then remove it from the heat. Let the mixture cool, strain out the vegetables, and pour the remains into a spray bottle using a funnel.
